Martin spent the late afternoon exploring the outskirts of a coastal town known for its abandoned radio tower. The tower stood on a rocky cliff, rusted and hollow, yet locals claimed it emitted a faint humming sound at dusk. Curious and restless, Martin decided to observe it himself.

As the sun set, the air grew colder and the steady rhythm of the waves below blended with an unusual vibration coming from the tower. A dim red light pulsed near the top, even though the structure was no longer connected to the power grid. The light flickered every few seconds, slow and deliberate, as if responding to something unseen.

Martin climbed partway up the hill and noticed fresh footprints near the tower’s base. They belonged to at least three different people, all heading toward the locked maintenance door. One set of footprints was smaller, possibly a child’s. Another set dragged slightly, like someone walking with a heavy load.

A thin layer of fog rolled in from the sea, muffling all distant sounds. The humming grew louder, vibrating through the ground beneath Martin’s feet. The red light shifted to a pale white glow that spread down the tower’s metal frame. For a moment, the entire structure felt alive.

Then, without warning, the light vanished. The humming stopped. The cliffside returned to silence, as if nothing had happened. The footprints remained, but the people who made them were nowhere in sight.

Martin felt a faint static sensation in the air around him, as if the tower had released something rather than consumed it.
